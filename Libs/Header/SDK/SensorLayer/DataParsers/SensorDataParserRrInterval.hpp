 * @file    SensorDataParserRrInterval.hpp
 * @brief   SensorData parser for the RR_INTERVAL (beat-to-beat) sensor.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL. There is no firmware producer yet, and 0x44 is not stable until
 * one has been written against this header.
 *
 * One beat-to-beat R-R interval per frame — the gap between consecutive
 * heartbeats, which is what RMSSD, SDNN and DFA alpha1 are computed from. Opt-in:
 * offering it must not change what a HEART_RATE consumer already sees.
 *
 * FIELD LAYOUT. Positional, each field a fixed type in the Data union — unlike
 * HEART_RATE_EX this frame is not all-float, so a producer writes through the
 * matching writer (.f / .u) or a consumer reads garbage.
 *
 *   [0] rr_ms   float, REQUIRED — the interval in milliseconds
 *   [1] source  u32   — Source
 *   [2] flags   u32   — Flag bits
 *   [3] RESERVED for a graded per-beat confidence. Nothing else may take it.
 *
 * Data carries no in-band length field, so a frame cannot hold a variable-length
 * burst: the several intervals of one 0x2A37 notification arrive as consecutive
 * one-interval frames, and a consumer iterates DataBatch::size() rather than
 * assuming one frame per callback.
 *
 * WHAT A PRODUCER OWES is in Docs/ExternalSensors.md, beside the 0x2A37 decode a
 * producer has to perform anyway. Why the budget below is the size it is, and
 * which values are still open, are in the pull request that introduced this file.
 *
 * TIMESTAMP. The frame stamp is the beat instant the interval ends on. That is
 * the invariant, not how a producer reaches it: a detector reporting beat instants
 * stamps them and sets DETECTOR_STAMPED, one seeing only arrival reconstructs them
 * and leaves the bit clear. Unlike a field this cannot be tightened later, because
 * a consumer relying on true beat instants breaks the moment a producer stops
 * supplying them.
 *
 * The stamp is TWO FIELDS AND THE SECOND IS A REMAINDER. getTimestampUs() forms
 * ms * 1000 + us, a duration only while us stays under 1000, so whole milliseconds
 * go in mTimeStamp and sub-millisecond microseconds in mTimeStampUs, as
 * SensorDataSample::setTimestampUs writes them. Used as a full counter the field
 * doubles the apparent interval. checkContinuity() answers UNUSABLE for a frame it
 * can see breaking this, which is a backstop and not a guarantee: it cannot inspect
 * prevUs, a full counter landing under 1000 by chance still gets a verdict, and a
 * frame declaring DISCONTINUITY is answered before the check is reached.
 *
 * CONTINUITY. rr_ms is authoritative for the interval VALUE, the timestamp for
 * CONTINUITY, so a disagreement between t[n] - t[n-1] and rr[n] is a lost or
 * reordered frame and nothing else detects one — there is no sequence number.
 * checkContinuity() IS that check. Do not compare the stamps for equality; the
 * budget is what the verdict rests on.
 *
 * DISCONTINUITY outranks the stamps and is answered before them. Zero is "no
 * stamp" at either end.
 *
 * The budget is a WINDOW, not a bound. A slow connection interval, a link-layer
 * retransmission or a drain stall each produce an honest comparison reading GAP,
 * and nothing here rules them out: read an isolated GAP as one gap that cannot be
 * accounted for, not as a corrupt stream. A consumer holding a real figure passes
 * it to the two-argument overload. Erring loose is deliberate — the expensive
 * error is the false positive, which discards the windows the strap was connected
 * for.
 *
 * Two accepted residuals. A lost beat goes undetected once
 * the whole missing interval fits inside the budget, which is a rate above
 * kGuaranteedDetectableBpm; and Data's millisecond field is uint32, so the single
 * pair straddling its wrap reads REORDERED.
 *
 * CONSUMER OBLIGATION. The stamp you pass is the previous frame whose
 * isDataValid() HELD — whatever verdict that frame got — and zero until you have
 * seen one. Nothing checks it, and both ways of getting it wrong are silent.
 * Advance across an invalid frame and you carry its zero forward, so the next
 * pair reads UNUSABLE where a beat's interval in fact went unreported, which is
 * a GAP and a window to discard. Advance only on CONTIGUOUS
 * and nothing re-establishes the stream after a reordering.
