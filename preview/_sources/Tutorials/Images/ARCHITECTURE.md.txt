## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting the Import Images tutorial, you need to set up the UNA SDK environment. Follow the [Windows Setup section of sdk-setup.md](../../sdk-setup.md#windows-setup) for complete installation instructions, including:

- UNA SDK cloned (`git clone https://github.com/UNAWatch/una-sdk.git`)
- ST ARM GCC Toolchain (from STM32CubeIDE/CubeCLT, not system GCC)
- CMake 3.21+ and make
- Python 3 with pip packages installed
- TouchGFX Designer installed (see [Windows Setup section of sdk-setup.md](../../sdk-setup.md#windows-setup))

**Minimum requirements for Import Images:**
- `UNA_SDK` environment variable pointing to SDK root
- ARM GCC toolchain in PATH
- CMake and build tools
- TouchGFX Designer for GUI development
- Image editing software (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)

### Building and Running Import Images

1. **Verify your environment setup** (see [Windows Setup section of sdk-setup.md](../../sdk-setup.md#windows-setup) for details):
    ```bash
    echo $UNA_SDK                   # Should point to SDK root.
                                    # Note for backward compatibility with linux path notation it uses '/'

    which arm-none-eabi-gcc         # Should find ST toolchain
    which cmake                     # Should find CMake
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Images tutorial directory:**
    ```bash
    cd $UNA_SDK/Docs/Tutorials/Images
    ```

3. **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../Software/Apps/Images-CMake
    make
    ```

The app will start and display imported images on screen, demonstrating the complete image import workflow in UNA apps.

### Running on Simulator

To test the app on the simulator (Windows only):

1. Open `Images.touchgfx` in TouchGFX Designer and click **Generate Code (F4)** (do this once).
2. Navigate to `Images\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator\msvs`
3. Open `Application.vcxproj` in Visual Studio
4. Press **F5** to start debugging and run the simulator

In the simulator, use keyboard keys to interact:
- **1** = L1 (Toggle between Image and ScalableImage modes)
- **3** = R1 (Trigger jump animation when in Image mode)

The simulator will display the imported character image with scaling and animation capabilities. For detailed simulator setup and button mapping, see [Simulator](../../Simulator.md).

## Images App Overview

The Images tutorial demonstrates programmatic image display and interactivity in UNA Watch apps:

### Key Features Demonstrated
- **No background**: Pure programmatic content - no designer-generated backgrounds or boxes
- **Dual image modes**: L1 toggles between Image (`guyImage`) and ScalableImage (`scaledGuyImage`)
- **Jump animation**: R1 triggers sine-wave Y-offset animation on `guyImage` via tick events

### The Asset Pipeline
- **Creation**: Images are created using external tools (Paint, GIMP, etc.)
- **Import**: Images are added to TouchGFX Designer project
- **Conversion**: TouchGFX converts images to optimized bitmap formats
- **Storage**: Converted images are stored in flash memory
- **Display**: Images are referenced by ID and displayed on screen

### The GUI Layer (Frontend)
- Built with TouchGFX framework. For detailed information about the TouchGFX port implementation, see [TouchGFX Port Architecture](../../TouchGFX-Port-Architecture.md)
- Programmatically adds images in [`setupScreen()`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/gui/src/main_screen/MainView.cpp)
- Handles L1/R1 buttons for mode switching and animation triggers in [`handleKeyEvent()`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/gui/src/main_screen/MainView.cpp)
- Drives animation in [`handleTickEvent()`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/gui/src/main_screen/MainView.cpp)

### Image Management in UNA SDK
- Images are converted to TouchGFX bitmap format during build
- Each image gets a unique ID in [`BitmapDatabase.hpp`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/generated/images/include/images/BitmapDatabase.hpp)
- Images are stored in flash memory for efficient access
- TouchGFX handles image decompression and display

## Image Import Process

Follow these steps to import and display images in your UNA app:

### Step 1: Create Your Image Asset

1. **Open your image editor** (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)

2. **Create a new image** with appropriate dimensions:
    - Consider the UNA Watch display (typically 240x240 pixels)
    - Use power-of-2 dimensions when possible for better compression
    - Choose appropriate color depth (RGB565 for photos, indexed for icons)

3. **Draw or import your graphic**:
    - For this tutorial, create a simple character or icon
    - Save as PNG format with transparency if needed

4. **Save your image** as `my_image.png` in a temporary location

### Step 2: Import into TouchGFX Designer

1. **Open the TouchGFX project**:
    ```
    Images.touchgfx
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Images tab** in TouchGFX Designer

3. **Click "Import Images"** and select your `my_image.png` file   

![Add Image Button](doc-assets/add-image-button.png)

4. **Configure image settings**:
    - Choose appropriate color format (RGB565, ARGB8888, etc.)
    - Enable dithering if needed for better quality
    - Set compression options

5. **Generate code** after importing:
    - Click "Generate Code" in TouchGFX Designer

![Generated Image Asset](doc-assets/generated-image-asset.png)

    - This creates bitmap IDs and conversion code

### Step 3: Display the Image in Code

After importing `guy-transparent.png`, TouchGFX generates [`BITMAP_GUY_TRANSPARENT_ID`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/generated/images/include/images/BitmapDatabase.hpp).

Images are added programmatically in [`MainView::setupScreen()`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/gui/src/main_screen/MainView.cpp):

```cpp
// Programmatic image setup - no background
guyImage.setBitmap(touchgfx::Bitmap(BITMAP_GUY_TRANSPARENT_ID));
guyImage.setPosition(70, originalY, 100, 100);
guyImage.setVisible(false);  // Initially hidden (scaled mode active)
add(guyImage);

scaledGuyImage.setBitmap(touchgfx::Bitmap(BITMAP_GUY_TRANSPARENT_ID));
scaledGuyImage.setPosition(70, originalY, 120, 120);
scaledGuyImage.setScalingAlgorithm(touchgfx::ScalableImage::BILINEAR_INTERPOLATION);
scaledGuyImage.setVisible(true);  // Initially shown
add(scaledGuyImage);
```

**Note**: Widgets declared as members in [`MainView.hpp`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/gui/include/gui/main_screen/MainView.hpp). Includes placed in header.

### Step 4: Build and Test

1. **Rebuild the application**:
    ```bash
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../Software/Apps/Images-CMake
    make
    ```

2. **Run on simulator** to see your imported image displayed

3. **Test on hardware** to verify performance and appearance

## Code Details

### Understanding Bitmap IDs

When you import images into TouchGFX, each image gets a unique ID defined in `BitmapDatabase.hpp`:

```cpp
// Generated by imageconverter. Please, do not edit!
#ifndef TOUCHGFX_BITMAPDATABASE_HPP
#define TOUCHGFX_BITMAPDATABASE_HPP

#include <touchgfx/hal/Types.hpp>
#include <touchgfx/Bitmap.hpp>

const uint16_t BITMAP_GUY_TRANSPARENT_ID = 0;

// Additional bitmap IDs for other images...
```

### Using Images in TouchGFX Widgets\n\n**Suggested additional screenshots:**\n- Static scaled image display\n- Image during custom jump animation (triggered by R1 button)\n- Toggle between scaled and animated modes\n\n

TouchGFX provides several ways to display images:

**No Background:**
The demo has no background image or box. All content is added programmatically in [`setupScreen()`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/gui/src/main_screen/MainView.cpp).

**ScalableImage (scaledGuyImage):**
```cpp
scaledGuyImage.setBitmap(touchgfx::Bitmap(BITMAP_GUY_TRANSPARENT_ID));
scaledGuyImage.setPosition(70, originalY, 120, 120);
scaledGuyImage.setScalingAlgorithm(touchgfx::ScalableImage::BILINEAR_INTERPOLATION);
scaledGuyImage.setVisible(true);
add(scaledGuyImage);
```

**Custom Tick-Based Animation:**
Demo uses `handleTickEvent()` for sine-wave jump on `guyImage`:
- Triggered by R1 when Image mode active
- 60 ticks (~6s at 10Hz), sin(phase)*30px offset
(See [`MainView.cpp`](Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI/gui/src/main_screen/MainView.cpp))

### Image Memory Management

Images in UNA apps are stored in flash memory and loaded into RAM as needed:

- **Flash Storage**: Images are compressed and stored in internal/external flash
- **RAM Usage**: Only active images are decompressed into RAM
- **Caching**: TouchGFX manages image caching automatically
- **Optimization**: Use appropriate color depths to balance quality and memory usage

## Best Practices

### Image Creation
- Use vector graphics when possible for scalability
- Choose appropriate color depths (RGB565 for most cases)
- Consider transparency needs (ARGB8888 for transparent images)
- Test images on actual device for color accuracy

### Import Optimization
- Enable dithering for better quality on limited color displays
- Use compression options to reduce flash usage
- Group similar images for better compression
- Consider image dimensions vs. display capabilities

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize number of active images on screen
- Use appropriate scaling algorithms
- Avoid frequent image switching in animations
- Profile memory usage on target hardware

### File Organization
- Keep original source images in `assets/images/`
- Use descriptive names for bitmap IDs
- Document image purposes and dimensions
- Version control your image assets

## Next Steps

1. **Import your first image** - Follow the steps above to add a custom image to the tutorial app
2. **Experiment with different formats** - Try various color depths and compression settings
3. **Create image sequences** - Import multiple frames for animations
4. **Optimize for performance** - Test memory usage and display performance
5. **Explore advanced features** - Study TouchGFX documentation for effects and transformations
6. **Continue to other tutorials** - Learn about buttons, text, and complex interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Import Issues
- Ensure image dimensions are reasonable for the display
- Check that TouchGFX Designer is properly installed
- Verify image format is supported (PNG, BMP, etc.)
- Regenerate code after making changes

### Display Problems
- Confirm bitmap ID is correct in `BitmapDatabase.hpp`
- Check image position and dimensions fit the screen
- Verify color format matches display capabilities
- Test on simulator first, then hardware

### Build Errors
- Ensure TouchGFX project is synchronized with CMake build
- Check for missing image files in assets directory
- Verify bitmap database is regenerated after changes
- Clean build directory and rebuild if issues persist

### Performance Issues
- Reduce image resolution if memory constrained
- Use simpler color formats (RGB565 vs ARGB8888)
- Limit number of simultaneous images
