# Running - Running Activity Tracking

## Overview

The Running app is a comprehensive running activity tracking application designed for wearable devices. It provides real-time tracking of distance, pace, heart rate, elevation, and other essential metrics for runners. The app integrates multiple sensors including GPS, heart rate monitor, barometric pressure sensor, and battery monitoring to deliver accurate and detailed activity data.

The application follows a modular architecture with separate service and GUI components, communicating through a custom message system. It supports features like automatic lap splitting based on distance or time, activity data persistence in FIT file format, and a rich TouchGFX-based user interface with multiple watch faces and screens.

Key features include:
- Real-time GPS tracking with position and pace data
- Heart rate monitoring with trust level assessment
- Elevation tracking using barometric pressure
- Automatic and manual lap recording
- Interval training with configurable run/rest phases, repeat counts, and time- or distance-based boundaries
- Multiple watch face layouts, including a dedicated intervals face
- Activity summary with per-lap breakdown
- Battery level monitoring
- Settings for alerts, notifications, and interval workout configuration

## Architecture

The Running app follows a client-server architecture pattern where the service component handles all backend logic, sensor management, and data processing, while the GUI component manages user interaction and display. Communication between these components occurs through a message-based system using the UNA SDK's kernel infrastructure.

### High-Level Components

1. **Service Layer**: Core business logic, sensor integration, data processing
2. **GUI Layer**: TouchGFX-based user interface, screen management
3. **SDK Integration**: Kernel, sensor layer, file system, messaging
4. **Data Persistence**: FIT file format for activity data, JSON for settings

### Component Interaction

```
[Hardware Sensors] <-> [Sensor Layer] <-> [Service]
        ^                    ^                ^
        |                    |                |
[Kernel Messages] <-- [Message System] --> [GUI]
```

The service runs as a separate process/thread, continuously processing sensor data and maintaining activity state. The GUI runs on the TouchGFX framework, handling user input and displaying data received from the service.

## Service Backend

The service backend is implemented in `Service.hpp` and `Service.cpp`, providing the core functionality for activity tracking and sensor management.

### Core Classes and Structures

#### Service Class

The main service class handles all backend logic for running activity tracking. It manages sensor connections, processes sensor data, maintains activity and interval state, and communicates with the GUI through the UNA SDK's messaging system. The service runs as a separate process/thread and handles lifecycle management through the kernel interface.

Because the interval training feature relies on intelligent wrist-raise detection during running (where arm motion would fool a simple motion event), the service also inherits `WristTiltDetector::IListener` to receive backlight activation callbacks:

```cpp
class Service : public WristTiltDetector::IListener
{
public:
    Service(SDK::Kernel &kernel);

    virtual ~Service();

    void run();

private:
    SDK::Kernel&          mKernel;
    bool                  mGuiStarted;
    CustomMessage::Sender mGuiSender;
    // ... additional members
};
```

#### Key Data Structures

**Track Data (`Track::Data`)** — real-time metrics snapshot sent to the GUI every second. Contains pace, distance, time, lap counters, HR (current/avg/max/lap), speed (current/avg/max/lap), and elevation — all in SI units (m, m/s, s/m, bpm). Also includes `intervalsMode: bool` and an `IntervalsData intervals` snapshot for the current interval phase. Defined in `Libs/Header/Track.hpp`.

**Interval types** defined in `Track.hpp`:

```cpp
enum class IntervalsPhase { WARM_UP, RUN, REST, COOL_DOWN };
enum class IntervalsMetric { TIME_OPEN, TIME_REMAINING, TIME_ELAPSED, DISTANCE };

struct IntervalsData {
    IntervalsPhase  phase;
    IntervalsMetric metric;
    uint8_t         repeat;         ///< 1-based current RUN-REST cycle
    uint8_t         totalRepeats;   ///< Total configured RUN-REST cycles
    std::time_t     phaseTimerSec;  ///< Time elapsed in current phase
    float           distRemaining;  ///< Distance remaining (DISTANCE metric only)
};
```

### Sensor Integration

Each sensor is represented by an `SDK::Sensor::Connection` object. Polled sensors are configured with a period and latency; event-based sensors fire when the hardware generates an event and ignore those parameters.

**Polled sensors** (1000 ms period / 1000 ms latency):

| Sensor | Type constant | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| GPS Location | `GPS_LOCATION` | Coordinates, altitude, fix state; used for map building |
| GPS Speed | `GPS_SPEED` | Instantaneous speed → `mSpeedCounter` |
| GPS Distance | `GPS_DISTANCE` | Incremental distance → `mDistanceCounter` |
| Heart Rate | `HEART_RATE` | BPM + trust level (1–3) → `mHrCounter` |
| Pressure | `PRESSURE` | Barometric altitude (filtered) → `mAltitudeCounter` |
| Battery Metrics | `BATTERY_METRICS` | Voltage → `mBatteryVoltage` |
| Sensor Fusion | `FUSION_RAW` | IMU accelerometer/gyro at 100 Hz → `WristTiltDetector` |

**Event-based sensors** (period/latency ignored):

| Sensor | Type constant | Purpose |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Battery Level | `BATTERY_LEVEL` | State of charge → `mBatterySoc` |
| Wrist Motion | `WRIST_MOTION` | Wrist raise → immediate backlight activation |

#### Sensor Connection Management

The two backlight sensors follow different lifecycle rules:

- **WRIST_MOTION** — connected on GUI start, disconnected on GUI stop. Active at all times while the app is visible (main menu, settings, and during tracking).
- **SENSOR_FUSION** (100 Hz) — connected only when tracking starts (via `connectSensors()`), disconnected when tracking stops. Feeds the `WristTiltDetector` which provides motion-aware backlight during running when simple wrist-raise events would be masked by arm movement.

All remaining tracking sensors (GPS, Heart Rate, Pressure, Battery Level/Metrics) are also connected when tracking starts. GPS Location is additionally connected on GUI start for early fix acquisition.

### Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline transforms raw sensor data into meaningful fitness metrics.

#### 1. Sensor Data Reception

Sensor data arrives through the kernel's message system. The `handleSensorsData()` method identifies the source via `matchesDriver()`, constructs the appropriate parser, and forwards the value:

```cpp
void Service::handleSensorsData(uint16_t handle, SDK::Sensor::DataBatch& data) {
    if (mSensorGpsLocation.matchesDriver(handle)) {
        SDK::SensorDataParser::GpsLocation parser(data[0]);
        if (parser.isDataValid()) {
            mGps.timestamp = parser.getTimestamp();
            mGps.fix = parser.isCoordinatesValid();
            if (mGps.fix) {
                parser.getCoordinates(mGps.latitude, mGps.longitude, mGps.altitude);
            }
        }
    }
    // ... additional sensor handlers
}
```

#### 2. Data Capture Infrastructure

GPS coordinates, battery level, and sensor metrics are collected through three complementary mechanisms that together ensure accurate, pause-aware data:

**GPS state (`mGps`)** — a simple struct updated on every GPS location event: fix flag, latitude/longitude, altitude (m), and timestamp. Used both for map building and for flagging whether coordinate/speed data is valid before writing to FIT.

**Battery samplers** — two `SDK::Metric::ThrottledSample` instances (`mBatterySoc`, `mBatteryVoltage`) that periodically write state-of-charge (%) and voltage (V) into the FIT file without flooding it with redundant records.

**SDK Metric counters** — all sensor values that feed into `Track::Data` pass through one of three SDK counter types from `SDK::Metric`. Counters are the central reason accurate per-lap and per-activity statistics are possible with minimal service logic: each counter automatically excludes time spent in the paused state from active totals, separates per-lap values from session totals via `resetLap()`, and silently rejects sensor anomalies (rollbacks, out-of-range spikes) before they corrupt averages.

| Counter | Suitable for | Used for |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `MonotonicCounter<T>` | Cumulative values that only increase; ignores decreasing sensor readings | `mTimeCounter`, `mDistanceCounter` |
| `VariableCounter` | Fluctuating values; filters readings outside a valid range; tracks avg/min/max per lap | `mSpeedCounter`, `mHrCounter` |
| `DeltaCounter` | Bidirectional changes; accumulates ascent and descent separately with a noise threshold | `mAltitudeCounter` |

Raw barometric altitude is pre-filtered through a `SimpleLPF` (α = 0.8) before being passed to `mAltitudeCounter`, because `DeltaCounter` does not perform any filtering itself.

#### 3. Parser Classes

Each sensor has a corresponding `SDK::SensorDataParser::*` class. The pattern is always the same: construct the parser from `data[0]`, check `isDataValid()`, then extract the value and feed it into the appropriate counter or struct field. The pressure sensor is slightly more complex because it requires a sea-level calibration on the first reading:

```cpp
SDK::SensorDataParser::Pressure parser(data[0]);
if (parser.isDataValid()) {
    if (!mAltitudeCounter.isValid()) {
        mSeaLevelPressure = parser.getP0();  // calibrate on first reading
    }
    float altitude = parser.getAltitude(parser.getPressure(), mSeaLevelPressure);
    mAltitudeCounter.add(mAltitudeFilter.execute(altitude));  // pre-filter before DeltaCounter
}
```

SENSOR_FUSION batches are unpacked differently: up to 10 raw IMU samples are accumulated into a `TiltImuSample[10]` array and flushed to `mWristTiltDetector.addBatch()` each time the batch is full or the data batch ends.

All other parsers (`GpsLocation`, `GpsSpeed`, `GpsDistance`, `HeartRate`, `BatteryLevel`, `BatteryMetrics`, `WristMotion`) follow the simpler `isDataValid()` → `counter.add(value)` / action pattern.

#### 4. Track Processing Logic

The `processTrack()` method runs every second during active tracking:

```cpp
void Service::processTrack() {
    // GPS map building
    if (mGps.fix && mTrackState == Track::State::ACTIVE) {
        mTrackMapBuilder.addPoint({mGps.latitude, mGps.longitude});
    }

    // Aggregate data for GUI
    mTrackData.totalTime = mTimeCounter.getValueActive();
    mTrackData.distance  = mDistanceCounter.getValueActive();
    mTrackData.speed     = mSpeedCounter.getCurrent();

    // Calculate pace (s/m → converted to min/km or min/mile in GUI)
    mTrackData.pace = getPace(mTrackData.speed, mSpeedCounter.getMinValid());

    // Update GUI
    mGuiSender.trackData(mTrackData);

    // FIT file recording
    if (mTrackState == Track::State::ACTIVE) {
        ActivityWriter::RecordData fitRecord = prepareRecordData();
        mActivityWriter.addRecord(fitRecord);
    }

    // Interval training progression check
    if (mIntervalsMode && !mIntervalsCompleted) {
        processIntervals();
    }
}
```

#### 5. FIT File Recording

Activity data is recorded in FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) format, the standard for fitness devices.

Each record is assembled from the current counter values and GPS state. Fields are optional — each is only written to the FIT file when marked valid via `RecordData::set(Field, bool)`. Fields include: coordinates, speed, altitude, heart rate, and battery (both `mBatterySoc` and `mBatteryVoltage` `ThrottledSample` instances must both be `isDue()` before the battery fields are written).

#### 6. Error Handling and Data Validation

**GPS Fix State Management**:

Fix state changes are tracked via `mPreviousGpsFixState`. On every change the GUI is notified via `mGuiSender.fix()`. The very first acquired fix also triggers `notifyFirstFix()` — backlight on, buzzer pattern (150 ms × 3), and a strong vibro click:

```cpp
if (mPreviousGpsFixState != mGps.fix) {
    mPreviousGpsFixState = mGps.fix;
    if (!firstFix) {
        notifyFirstFix();
        firstFix = true;
    }
    mGuiSender.fix(mGps.fix);
}
```

**Heart Rate Trust Level Filtering**:

HR readings are only written to the FIT file when the value is above 20 bpm and the sensor trust level is in the valid range 1–3 (0 means no signal):

```cpp
bool hasHeartRate = (mHrCounter.getCurrent() > 20 &&
                    mTrackData.hrTrustLevel >= 1 &&
                    mTrackData.hrTrustLevel <= 3);
fitRecord.set(ActivityWriter::RecordData::Field::HEART_RATE, hasHeartRate);
```

**WRIST_MOTION Backlight Activation**:

```cpp
SDK::SensorDataParser::WristMotion parser(data[0]);
if (parser.isDataValid()) {
    backlightOn();  // brightness 100%, auto-off after skBacklightTimeout (5000 ms)
}
```

`backlightOn()` is a shared helper used across the service (first GPS fix, lap end, wrist motion, WristTiltDetector callback). It sends a `RequestBacklightSet` message with brightness 100% and the default 5-second auto-off timeout.

### Activity State Management

The service maintains track state through `Track::State` enum:
- `INACTIVE`: No active tracking
- `ACTIVE`: Currently recording activity
- `PAUSED`: Tracking suspended

State transitions are handled by `startTrack()`, `stopTrack()`, `pauseTrack()`.

### Lap Management

Laps can be triggered automatically based on configurable thresholds:
- **Distance-based**: Configurable via `MenuDistanceView` (`Settings::Alerts::Distance::Id`)
- **Time-based**: Configurable via `MenuTimeView` (`Settings::Alerts::Time::Id`)
- **Manual**: User-initiated via R2 button during tracking

Lap data includes timing, distance, average pace, HR, and ascent/descent (written to FIT).

### Interval Training

Interval training is a Running-specific feature that guides the runner through structured workout phases. When started with `intervalsMode = true`, the service drives the phase state machine alongside normal track processing.

#### Configuration

The interval workout is configured in `Settings::Intervals`:

```cpp
struct Intervals {
    static constexpr uint8_t kRepeatsMax = 20;

    enum Metric { OPEN = 0, TIME, DISTANCE };

    uint8_t  repeatsNum   = 0;       ///< Number of RUN-REST cycles
    Metric   runMetric    = OPEN;    ///< How the RUN phase ends
    uint32_t runTime      = 0;       ///< RUN phase duration (s), used when metric == TIME
    float    runDistance  = 0.0f;    ///< RUN phase distance (m), used when metric == DISTANCE
    Metric   restMetric   = OPEN;    ///< How the REST phase ends
    uint32_t restTime     = 0;       ///< REST phase duration (s), used when metric == TIME
    float    restDistance = 0.0f;    ///< REST phase distance (m), used when metric == DISTANCE
    bool     warmUp       = true;    ///< Prepend WARM_UP phase before first RUN
    bool     coolDown     = true;    ///< Append COOL_DOWN phase after last REST
};
```

#### Phase State Machine

Phases progress in order: `WARM_UP` → `RUN` → `REST` → … → `RUN` → `REST` → `COOL_DOWN`. `WARM_UP` and `COOL_DOWN` are always `TIME_OPEN` (no automatic boundary — the runner advances manually by pressing R2). `RUN` and `REST` use the configured `Metric`:

- `OPEN` — no automatic advance; runner presses R2 to move to next phase
- `TIME` — advance automatically when elapsed phase time reaches the configured duration
- `DISTANCE` — advance automatically when elapsed distance since phase start reaches the configured distance

The service tracks the active-time and active-distance at each phase entry:

```cpp
mPhaseStartActiveSec  = mTimeCounter.getValueActive();
mPhaseStartActiveDist = mDistanceCounter.getValueActive();
```

`processIntervals()` runs every second inside `processTrack()` and compares current counters against the phase boundary. `advanceIntervalsPhase(bool manual)` moves to the next phase (or marks the workout complete after the final phase).

#### Interval Phase Notifications

On every phase change, `onIntervalsPhaseChange(bool alert, bool manual)` is called:
- If `alert` is true, `mGuiSender.intervalsPhaseAlert(mTrackData.intervals)` sends an `INTERVALS_PHASE_ALERT` message to the GUI, which navigates to `TrackIntervalsAlertView` and shows a countdown timer before returning to the track screen.
- When the entire workout is complete (all repeats done and `COOL_DOWN` phase ended or skipped), `mGuiSender.intervalsWorkoutCompleted()` sends `INTERVALS_WORKOUT_COMPLETED` and sets `mIntervalsCompleted = true` to block further phase processing.

### WristTiltDetector

During running, arm swing can trigger a simple wrist-motion event repeatedly, making the backlight flash with every stride. The `WristTiltDetector` solves this by analysing the full IMU signal from the `FUSION_RAW` sensor at 100 Hz and only firing a callback when a genuine wrist-raise tilt is detected.

```cpp
mWristTiltDetector.setConfig(config);  // sampleRateHz = 100
mWristTiltDetector.setListener(this);  // Service implements IListener
```

The detector classifies motion state (STATIONARY / WALKING / RUNNING) from the AY-axis swing amplitude using a sliding window. It then applies dynamic GX thresholds per motion class — higher thresholds during running to suppress false positives from arm swing. When a genuine tilt is detected:

```cpp
virtual void Service::onWristTilt(uint32_t timestampMs) override {
    backlightOn();
}
```

The `SENSOR_FUSION` connection is only active during tracking. Outside tracking (main menu, settings), the simpler `WRIST_MOTION` event sensor handles the backlight.

### Settings and Persistence

Settings are stored in JSON format and include:
- Alert distance threshold (`Settings::Alerts::Distance::Id`)
- Alert time threshold (`Settings::Alerts::Time::Id`)
- Auto-pause enable flag (`auto_pause_en`; persisted only — see below)
- Phone notification enablement
- Interval workout configuration (`Settings::Intervals`)

#### Auto-pause (hidden in UI)

- **UI:** Auto Pause is not shown on the settings wheel (`ID_AUTO_PAUSE` is removed from `App::MenuNav::Root::Settings::Id`, and `MenuSettingsView` no longer contains auto-pause menu switch cases).
- **Persisted:** `Settings::autoPauseEn` and JSON key `auto_pause_en` are still loaded and saved by `SettingsSerializer`.
- **Runtime:** No service logic reads `autoPauseEn` today; only manual pause/resume (`TRACK_PAUSE` / `pauseTrack()`) is implemented.
- **Rationale:** Auto-pause was never fully implemented; showing the toggle caused confusion. The feature is deferred while other work is prioritized.
- **Re-enabling:** Re-add `ID_AUTO_PAUSE` to `AppMenu.hpp`, restore auto-pause branches in `MenuSettingsView`/`MenuSettingsPresenter`, then implement detection in `Service` gated on `mSettings.autoPauseEn`.

### Activity Data Management and Persistence

#### FIT File Format Implementation

**ActivityWriter** — writes activity data to a FIT file during tracking. Key methods: `start()`, `addRecord()` (called every second), `addLap()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `stop()`, `discard()`. Each `RecordData` carries an optional-field bitmask so only valid sensor readings are written.

#### Activity Summary Persistence

**ActivitySummarySerializer** — loads and saves `ActivitySummary` as JSON. Used at activity end (`save`) and on next app launch (`load`) to restore the last session for display in the summary screens.

**ActivitySummary Structure**:
```cpp
struct LapSummary {
    time_t duration;   ///< Lap duration in seconds
    float  distance;   ///< Lap distance in m
    float  paceAvg;    ///< Average pace in s/m
};

struct ActivitySummary {
    time_t utc;                       ///< Last activity UTC time
    time_t time;                      ///< Total track time in seconds
    float  distance;                  ///< Total track distance in m
    float  speedAvg;                  ///< Average speed in m/s
    float  elevation;                 ///< Elevation in m
    float  paceAvg;                   ///< Average pace in s/m
    float  hrMax;                     ///< Maximum heart rate in bpm
    float  hrAvg;                     ///< Average heart rate in bpm
    SDK::TrackMapScreen map;          ///< Track map
    std::vector<LapSummary> laps;     ///< Per-lap summary data
};
```

#### Settings Persistence

**SettingsSerializer** — loads and saves `Settings` as JSON. Called on startup (`load`) and whenever the user changes a setting (`save`).

**Settings Structure**:
```cpp
struct Settings {
    bool autoPauseEn  = false;  // persisted; not on settings wheel until feature is implemented
    bool phoneNotifEn = true;
    Alerts::Distance::Id alertDistanceId = Alerts::Distance::ID_OFF;
    Alerts::Time::Id     alertTimeId     = Alerts::Time::ID_OFF;
    Intervals intervals {};
};
```

#### Data Synchronization

**Real-time GUI Updates**:
- Track data sent every second during active tracking
- Battery level updates on change
- GPS fix status notifications
- Lap completion events
- Interval phase change alerts

**Persistent Storage**:
- FIT files written continuously during activity
- Summary updated on activity completion
- Settings saved on change

## GUI

The GUI is built using the TouchGFX framework and follows the Model-View-Presenter pattern.

```

### Model-View-Presenter Pattern

The GUI follows MVP architecture:

- **Model**: `Model.hpp/cpp` — Data management and service communication
- **View**: Various view classes (`TrackView`, etc.) — UI rendering
- **Presenter**: Presenter classes — Logic binding model and view

### Model

The Model class (`gui/model/Model.hpp`) serves as the central data hub:

```cpp
class Model : public touchgfx::UIEventListener,
              public SDK::Interface::IGuiLifeCycleCallback,
              public SDK::Interface::ICustomMessageHandler {
public:
    void bind(ModelListener* listener);
    void tick();
    void handleKeyEvent(uint8_t key);
    void resetIdleTimer();
    void exitApp();

    // Time / date
    void getDate(uint8_t& month, uint8_t& day, uint8_t& weekday);
    void getTime(uint8_t& h, uint8_t& m, uint8_t& s);

    // Sensors & settings
    uint8_t getBatteryLevel() const;
    bool isUnitsImperial() const;
    const uint8_t* getHrThresholds() const;
    uint8_t getHrThresholdsCount() const;
    const Settings& getSettings() const;
    void saveSettings(const Settings& sett);
    bool hasGpsFix() const;

    // Track lifecycle
    void trackStart(bool intervalsMode);
    bool isTrackActive() const;
    void trackPause();
    void trackResume();
    bool isTrackPaused() const;
    const Track::Data& getTrackData() const;
    void saveLap();
    void saveTrack();
    void discardTrack();

    // Intervals
    void intervalsNextPhase();

    // Summary
    bool isTrackSummaryAvailable() const;
    const ActivitySummary& getTrackSummary() const;
};
```

Key responsibilities:
- Lifecycle management (`onStart`, `onResume`, `onSuspend`, `onStop`)
- Message handling from service (`ICustomMessageHandler`)
- Idle timeout management
- Menu position tracking

### Screens (26 total)

**Entry & Main Menu**:
- `MainView` — App entry point; scroll-wheel menu (Start, Intervals, Settings); GPS acquisition

**Tracking** (all face cycling happens inside `TrackView` via swipeable containers):
- `TrackView` — Active tracking screen; hosts `TrackFaceIntervals`, `TrackFaceTotal`, `TrackFaceLap`, `TrackFaceStatus` (swipe L1/L2)
- `TrackActionView` — Pause menu: Resume / Summary / Save / Discard
- `TrackLapView` — Lap-saved notification (auto-dismisses after 3 s)

**Confirmations**:
- `TrackStartConfirmationView` — Prompt to start without GPS fix; idle timeout → `MainView`
- `TrackHoldConfirmationView` — Hold R1 to confirm finish (→ `TrackSavedView`) or discard (→ `TrackDiscardedView`); release early cancels; idle timeout → `TrackActionView`
- `TrackDiscardedView` — Discard feedback (auto-dismisses after 3 s → exits app)
- `TrackSavedView` — Save feedback (auto-dismisses after 3 s → `TrackSummaryView`)

**Interval Notifications** (shown automatically on phase transitions):
- `TrackIntervalsAlertView` — Phase-change notification; shows new phase name, repeat counter, phase color; contains a countdown `IntervalsTimer` then auto-returns to `TrackView`
- `TrackIntervalsCountdownView` — Pre-start countdown before the first RUN phase
- `TrackIntervalsWorkoutCompletedView` — Workout complete notification; auto-dismisses to `TrackView`

**Summary** (all face cycling happens inside `TrackSummaryView`):
- `TrackSummaryView` — Post-activity summary; hosts `SummaryFaceMap`, `SummaryFaceOverview`, `SummaryFaceHeartRate`, `SummaryFaceLaps` (swipe L1/L2)
  - `SummaryFaceMap` — route map + total distance
  - `SummaryFaceOverview` — total distance, average pace, elapsed time
  - `SummaryFaceHeartRate` — max HR, average HR
  - `SummaryFaceLaps` — paginated lap list (5 rows visible, paged by 3 per L1/L2)

**Settings**:
- `MenuSettingsView` — Root settings wheel (Alerts, Phone Notifications; auto-pause hidden — see Auto-pause above)
- `MenuAlertsView` — Alert type selection (Distance, Time)
- `MenuDistanceView` — Distance alert value picker
- `MenuDistanceSavedView` — Save confirmation (auto-dismisses after 3 s → `MenuAlertsView`)
- `MenuTimeView` — Time alert value picker
- `MenuTimeSavedView` — Save confirmation (auto-dismisses after 3 s → `MenuAlertsView`)

**Intervals Configuration** (8 screens):
- `MenuIntervalsView` — Intervals root; shows current config summary; entry to sub-pickers
- `MenuIntervalsRepeatsView` — Repeat count picker (1–20)
- `MenuIntervalsRunView` — RUN phase metric selector (Open / Time / Distance)
- `MenuIntervalsRunTimeView` — RUN phase duration picker (time-based)
- `MenuIntervalsRunDistanceView` — RUN phase distance picker (distance-based)
- `MenuIntervalsRestView` — REST phase metric selector (Open / Time / Distance)
- `MenuIntervalsRestTimeView` — REST phase duration picker (time-based)
- `MenuIntervalsRestDistanceView` — REST phase distance picker (distance-based)

### Message Handling System

The Model implements `ICustomMessageHandler` to receive asynchronous updates from the service. Each message is cast to its concrete type, stored in a Model field, and forwarded to the active presenter via `ModelListener`:

```cpp
bool Model::customMessageHandler(SDK::MessageBase *msg) {
    switch (msg->getType()) {
        case CustomMessage::TRACK_DATA_UPDATE: {
            auto *cmsg = static_cast<CustomMessage::TrackDataUpd*>(msg);
            mTrackData = cmsg->data;                      // store
            modelListener->onTrackData(mTrackData);       // notify presenter
        } break;

        case CustomMessage::INTERVALS_PHASE_ALERT: {
            auto *cmsg = static_cast<CustomMessage::IntervalsPhaseAlert*>(msg);
            mIntervalsData = cmsg->intervals;
            modelListener->onIntervalsPhaseAlert(mIntervalsData);  // navigate to alert screen
        } break;

        case CustomMessage::INTERVALS_WORKOUT_COMPLETED: {
            modelListener->onIntervalsWorkoutCompleted();  // navigate to completed screen
        } break;

        // ... other message types follow the same pattern
        default: break;
    }
    return true;
}
```

Messages handled: `SETTINGS_UPDATE`, `LOCAL_TIME`, `BATTERY`, `GPS_FIX`, `TRACK_STATE_UPDATE`, `TRACK_DATA_UPDATE`, `LAP_END`, `SUMMARY`, `INTERVALS_PHASE_ALERT`, `INTERVALS_WORKOUT_COMPLETED`.

### Screen Navigation

All screen changes use `gotoXxxScreenNoTransition()` — there are no slide or animated screen transitions. Animations exist only within containers: `MainMenu` scroll-wheel, `ScrollIndicator` arc movement, and `IntervalsTimer` countdown ring.

**Screen Flow**:
```

### Custom Containers

The app uses two categories of containers: ready-made **SDK widgets** from `Templates/TouchGFX-Widgets` (imported as `.tpkg` packages) and **app-specific containers** built for this app's data and layout.

#### SDK Widget Containers

Imported from `Templates/TouchGFX-Widgets` and used without modification:

- `Battery` — 4-segment battery level indicator
- `Buttons` — button arc indicators (L1/L2/R1/R2)
- `GpsIndicator` — blinking GPS fix status dot
- `HeartRateZone` — 5-zone HR bar visualization
- `ScrollIndicator` — arc position indicator for face and menu navigation
- `MainMenu` — scroll-wheel menu with bundled `ScrollIndicator` and `Toggle`
- `Map` — route map with start/end markers
- `PauseIndicator` — full-width pause overlay with elapsed pause time
- `Title` — screen title with underline
- `InfoCarousel` — auto-cycling multi-value info panel

#### App-Specific Containers

Built specifically for this app and found in `gui/include/gui/containers/`:

**Track watch faces** (swipeable inside `TrackView`):
```cpp
// Intervals face — primary face when interval training is active
void TrackFaceIntervals::setPhase(Track::IntervalsPhase phase,
                                  uint8_t repeat, uint8_t totalRepeats);
void TrackFaceIntervals::setPhaseTime(std::time_t sec, Track::IntervalsMetric metric);
void TrackFaceIntervals::setPhaseDistance(float dist, bool isImperial);
void TrackFaceIntervals::setPace(float pace);   // visible during RUN phase
void TrackFaceIntervals::setHR(float hr);       // visible during REST phase
void TrackFaceIntervals::setPhaseColors(touchgfx::colortype neutral,
                                        touchgfx::colortype run,
                                        touchgfx::colortype rest);

// Total face — overall session metrics
void TrackFaceTotal::setPace(float pace);
void TrackFaceTotal::setDistance(float dist, bool isImperial);
void TrackFaceTotal::setTimer(std::time_t sec);

// Lap face — current lap metrics + HR zone
void TrackFaceLap::setHR(float hr, const uint8_t* thresholds, uint8_t thresholdCount);
void TrackFaceLap::setPace(float pace);
void TrackFaceLap::setDistance(float dist);
void TrackFaceLap::setTimer(std::time_t sec);

// Status face — clock + battery
void TrackFaceStatus::setTime(uint8_t h, uint8_t m);
void TrackFaceStatus::setBatteryLevel(uint8_t level);
```

**Summary faces** (swipeable inside `TrackSummaryView`):
```cpp
void SummaryFaceMap::setDistance(float dist, bool isImperial);
void SummaryFaceMap::setMap(const SDK::TrackMapScreen& map);

void SummaryFaceOverview::setDistance(float dist, bool isImperial);
void SummaryFaceOverview::setAvgPace(float pace);
void SummaryFaceOverview::setTimer(std::time_t sec);

void SummaryFaceHeartRate::setMaxHR(float hr);
void SummaryFaceHeartRate::setAvgHR(float hr);

// Paginated lap list: 5 rows visible, L1/L2 advance by 3 rows per press
void SummaryFaceLaps::setLaps(const std::vector<LapSummary>& laps, bool isImperial);
```

**Interval UI components**:
- `IntervalsTimer` — combined timer widget used inside `TrackFaceIntervals` and `TrackIntervalsAlertView`; supports time mode (`setPhaseTime()`), distance mode (`setPhaseDistance()`), and alert countdown mode (`setRemainingTime()`); exposes `setColor()` for phase-specific accent colour
- `TimerRing` — animated ring used for the pre-start countdown on `TrackIntervalsCountdownView`

**Utility**:
- `CountdownTimer` — self-registering countdown used by auto-dismiss screens (`TrackLapView`, `TrackSavedView`, `TrackDiscardedView`, `MenuDistanceSavedView`, `MenuTimeSavedView`)

### Input Handling

User input is processed through a hierarchical system:

1. **Hardware Events**: Button presses detected by TouchGFX HAL
2. **Key Event Processing**: `Model::handleKeyEvent()` for global actions
3. **Screen-Specific Handling**: View classes handle context-specific input

**Button Mapping**:
- **L1**: Previous item/navigation left
- **L2**: Next item/navigation right
- **R1**: Primary action (menu access)
- **R2**: Secondary action (lap / manual interval phase advance)

### Data Formatting and Units

The GUI handles unit conversions and formatting before passing values to containers:

- **Distance**: meters → km (metric) or miles (imperial)
- **Speed**: m/s → km/h or mi/h depending on unit setting
- **Pace**: seconds-per-metre → min/km or min/mile depending on unit setting
- **Elevation**: metres → feet in imperial mode
- **Time**: `std::time_t` seconds passed directly to containers; formatted as `H:MM:SS` by the container
- **HR**: raw bpm, no conversion required

### Idle Timeout

The app implements automatic screen timeout to conserve battery:

```cpp
void Model::decIdleTimer() {
    if (mIdleTimer > 0) {
        if (--mIdleTimer == 0) {
            modelListener->onIdleTimeout();
        }
    }
}

void Model::resetIdleTimer() {
    mIdleTimer = App::Config::kScreenTimeoutSteps;
}
```

Idle timer resets on any user interaction, preventing accidental timeouts during active use.

### TouchGFX Integration with UNA SDK

The integration between TouchGFX and UNA SDK is handled through several key components.

#### TouchGFXCommandProcessor

`SDK::TouchGFXCommandProcessor` is a singleton that bridges the SDK kernel and the TouchGFX event loop. It holds a `const SDK::Kernel&` reference internally and manages GUI lifecycle and incoming custom messages.

```cpp
namespace SDK {

class TouchGFXCommandProcessor {
public:
    static TouchGFXCommandProcessor& GetInstance();

    void setAppLifeCycleCallback(SDK::Interface::IGuiLifeCycleCallback* cb);
    void setCustomMessageHandler(SDK::Interface::ICustomMessageHandler* h);

    bool waitForFrameTick();
    bool getKeySample(uint8_t& key);
    void writeDisplayFrameBuffer(const uint8_t* data);

    // Called before Model::tick() on every frame
    void callCustomMessageHandler();
};

} // namespace SDK
```

`FrontendApplication::handleTickEvent()` calls `callCustomMessageHandler()` first, then `model.tick()`, ensuring pending service messages are dispatched to `ModelListener` before the presenter updates the view.

#### Kernel Provider Architecture

`SDK::KernelProviderGUI` is a singleton that stores a pointer to the `SDK::Kernel` object. It is initialised early in the program (before the GUI starts) and later retrieved by the `Model`:

```cpp
namespace SDK {

class KernelProviderGUI {
public:
    static KernelProviderGUI& CreateInstance(const SDK::Kernel* kernel);
    static KernelProviderGUI& GetInstance();

    const SDK::Kernel& getKernel();
};

} // namespace SDK
```

The `Model` constructor retrieves the kernel via `SDK::KernelProviderGUI::GetInstance().getKernel()`, ensuring the GUI has access to the same kernel instance used by the service.

#### Custom Message System

All service↔GUI messages are declared in `Commands.hpp` as plain `constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type` constants (not an enum) with fixed hex IDs. Every message struct inherits from `SDK::MessageBase`:

```cpp
namespace CustomMessage {

// Service --> GUI
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type SETTINGS_UPDATE           = 0x00000001;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type LOCAL_TIME                = 0x00000002;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type BATTERY                   = 0x00000003;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type GPS_FIX                   = 0x00000004;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type TRACK_STATE_UPDATE        = 0x00000005;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type TRACK_DATA_UPDATE         = 0x00000006;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type LAP_END                   = 0x00000007;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type SUMMARY                   = 0x00000008;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type INTERVALS_PHASE_ALERT     = 0x00000009;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type INTERVALS_WORKOUT_COMPLETED = 0x00000010;

// GUI --> Service
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type SETTINGS_SAVE        = 0x0000000A;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type TRACK_START          = 0x0000000B;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type TRACK_STOP           = 0x0000000C;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type TRACK_PAUSE          = 0x0000000D;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type TRACK_RESUME         = 0x0000000E;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type MANUAL_LAP           = 0x0000000F;
constexpr SDK::MessageType::Type INTERVALS_NEXT_PHASE = 0x00000011;

struct SettingsUpd : public SDK::MessageBase {
    Settings settings;
    bool     unitsImperial;
    uint8_t  hrThresholds[kHrThresholdsCount];  // C-array of 6
    uint8_t  hrThresholdsCount;
};

struct TrackDataUpd : public SDK::MessageBase {
    Track::Data data;
};

struct IntervalsPhaseAlert : public SDK::MessageBase {
    Track::IntervalsData intervals;  ///< Snapshot of the new phase
};

struct IntervalsWorkoutCompleted : public SDK::MessageBase {};

struct TrackStart : public SDK::MessageBase {
    bool intervalsMode = false;
};

struct IntervalsNextPhase : public SDK::MessageBase {};

// ... other structs follow the same pattern

} // namespace CustomMessage
```

#### Message Sender

**`CustomMessage::Sender`** provides type-safe message sending from the service to the GUI. Each method allocates a typed message via `mKernel.comm.allocateMessage<>()`, fills its fields, sends it, and releases it, returning `bool`:

```cpp
class Sender {
public:
    Sender(const SDK::Kernel& kernel);

    // Service --> GUI
    bool settingsUpd(Settings settings, bool units,
                     const uint8_t (&thresholds)[kHrThresholdsCount],
                     uint8_t thresholdCount);
    bool time(std::tm localTime);
    bool battery(uint8_t level);
    bool fix(bool state);
    bool trackState(Track::State state);
    bool trackData(const Track::Data& data);
    bool lapEnd(uint32_t lapNum);
    bool summary(const ActivitySummary* summaryPtr);
    bool intervalsPhaseAlert(const Track::IntervalsData& intervals);
    bool intervalsWorkoutCompleted();

    // GUI --> Service
    bool settingsSave(Settings settings);
    bool trackStart(bool intervalsMode);
    bool trackStop(bool discard);
    bool trackPause();
    bool trackResume();
    bool manualLap();
    bool intervalsNextPhase();
};
```

### Asset Management
