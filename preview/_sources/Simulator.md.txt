# UNA-Watch Simulator

The UNA Simulator runs on Windows (via TouchGFX Designer and Visual Studio) and on x86-64 Linux (via GCC and SDL2). The Getting Started steps below cover the Windows workflow for the TouchGFX apps; for Linux, see [Linux (GCC)](#linux-gcc). The [LVGL simulators](#lvgl-simulator) are plain CMake projects that need a compiler and SDL2 but no IDE.   
Note: If you move the application to another location, you need to update the relative path to **TouchGFX library path**.
      See: [Transfer Application](#transfer-application) 
## Getting Started
### Need Components
1. Download and install [TouchGFX Designer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/touchgfxdesigner.html#get-software).
2. If you want to work with UNA Simulator in Visual Studio, then:
   - Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).
   - In the Installing window, where you select the required packages, go to **Workloads → Desktop & Mobile** and choose **Desktop development with C++**.
   - In **Installation Details**, for **Desktop development with C++** select **MSVC v143**, then click **Install**.
### Install UNA_SDK variable {#install-una-sdk-variable}
1. Run the PowerShell script **export-stm32-tools.ps1**, located in:  
   `Utilities\Scripts\export-stm32-tools.ps1`
2. This script sets the UNA_SDK environment variable and configures STM32 tools.
### Start Simulator
#### TouchGFX Designer
1. TouchGFX Designer does not support **Debug mode**. If you want to debug the project, use Visual Studio.
2. Open `<name>.touchgfx`, located in:  
   `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI`
3. When opening the project for the first time, click **Generate Code (F4)**. This only needs to be done once.
4. Click **Run Simulator (F5)**.
#### Visual Studio
1. This step only needs to be done **once**. Open the application project in TouchGFX Designer and click **Generate Code (F4)**.
2. Go to:  
   `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator\msvs`
3. Open the **Application.vcxproj** file.
4. Start debugging by pressing **F5**.
### Simulation 
#### Buttons
1. Mechanical buttons in the UNA Simulator are controlled using **keyboard keys**.
2. You can see the mapping in the **Terminal Log**, which shows which number keys correspond to the buttons on the UNA watch.
   ```
   ---------------------------------------------------
   |   For Simulation Button use keyboard Keys.      |
   |       Keys Keyboard:                            |
   |       1   L1,                                   |
   |       2   L2,                                   |
   |       3   R1,                                   |
   |       4   R2                                    |
   |                  /---------\                    |
   |                 /           \                   |
   | BUTTON UP   L1 |             | R1 BUTTON SELECT |
   |                |     UNA     |                  |
   |                |    WATCH    |                  |
   | BUTTON DOWN L2 |             | R2 BUTTON BACK   |
   |                 \           /                   |
   |                  \---------/                    |
   ---------------------------------------------------
   ```
#### Buzzer
1. Buzzer actions are printed in the terminal as log messages. Example:
   ```cpp
   I- Mock.Buzzer::play::39               : [0] time=150 ms, level=3
   I- Mock.Buzzer::play::39               : [1] time=100 ms, level=0
   I- Mock.Buzzer::play::39               : [2] time=150 ms, level=3
   ```
2. Explanation:
   - **[]** — note array index
   - **time** — duration in milliseconds
   - **level** — sound level (1–3), 0 means no sound 
#### Backlight
1. Backlight actions are printed in the terminal as log messages.
   ```cpp
   I- Mock.Backlight::on::22              : called, timeout = 5000
   I- Mock.Backlight::off::30             : off backlight
   ```
2. There are two types of log messages:
   - turning the backlight on with a timeout in milliseconds
   - turning the backlight off
#### Vibro
1. Vibro actions are printed in the terminal as log messages.
   ```cpp
   I- Mock.Vibro::play::31                : play(melody[1])
   I- Mock.Vibro::play::34                :   [0] effect=1, loop=0, pause=0
   ```
2. Explanation:
   - **[]** — note array index
   - **effect** — vibration effect ID
   - **loop** — number of repetitions
   - **pause** — pause between effects
#### Sensors
In the file **ConfigurationSimulator.hpp**, you can enable/disable sensor simulation and configure parameters.

  ```cpp
   // IMU StepCounter Sensor
   #define IMU_STEP_COUNTER_SIM_ENABLE    1 // 0 - Disable
  ```

### Include Header & Source file
#### MSVS
1. Open **Application.vcxproj** in a text editor:
     `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator\msvs
2. Add header paths to **ClInclude**.
3. Add source file paths to **ClCompile**.
#### GCC {#gcc}
1. Open **MakeFile** in text editor:
  `<app-name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator\gcc`
2. Add header paths to **ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS**.
3. Add source file paths to **ADDITIONAL_SOURCES_UNA**.

The two lists describe the same build, so a file added to one must be added to
the other. A mismatch is not caught by a normal build: CI builds the GCC side
only, so a source missing from the vcxproj first shows up as a link error when
someone opens the project in Visual Studio. The `MSVS Source Sync` workflow
compares both lists on every pull request that touches either file. To run the
same check locally, from the SDK root (`python` on Windows):

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/check_msvs_sources.py
```

### Transfer Application {#transfer-application}
If you move the application to another location, you need to update the **TouchGFX library path**.
1. Open `<name>.touchgfx` in text editor:
    `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI`
2. Find **"TouchGfxPath":** and update the relative path to
   `<una_sdk>/ThirdParty/touchgfx.`
Example:
   ```cpp
    "SelectedStartupLanguage": "GB",
    "TouchGfxPath": "touchgfx",
    "UIPath": ".",
   ```

4. If you move the **una_sdk** folder, you must update UNA_SDK environment variable.
   See: [Install UNA_SDK variable](#install-una-sdk-variable) 

### Regenerate the GUI {#regenerate-gui}

Code generation normally runs from TouchGFX Designer (**Generate Code**, F4). The
same job runs headlessly with `tgfx`, the command line tool that ships with a
TouchGFX installation. Installing TouchGFX does not put it on `PATH`, so call it
by full path; on Windows that is `<touchgfx-install>\designer\tgfx.exe`. Run it
from the app's `TouchGFX-GUI` directory:

```powershell
& "<touchgfx-install>\designer\tgfx.exe" generate -p <name>.touchgfx
```

`-p` accepts either the `.touchgfx` file or the directory that holds it. The
command prints nothing on success unless `-v` is given, and `--clean` forces a
full regenerate. A run that changes no file content leaves no diff.

Generation rewrites two tracked files, `config/gcc/app.mk` and
`config/msvs/Application.props`, with paths taken from the machine that ran it.
Restore them before committing, so that a local installation path does not travel
into the repository:

```bash
git checkout -- config/gcc/app.mk config/msvs/Application.props
```

That discards every unstaged change in those two files, not only the ones
generation just made, so commit or stash your own edits to them first.

Set a `TouchGFXEnvPath` environment variable when TouchGFX is installed somewhere
other than the path `Application.props` names, otherwise the Visual Studio asset
pre-build cannot find the converters. The variable only wins where the project
declares the property conditionally:

```xml
<TouchGFXEnvPath Condition="'$(TouchGFXEnvPath)' == ''">...</TouchGFXEnvPath>
```

MSBuild gives a project property precedence over an environment one, so a project
that pins the path unconditionally ignores the variable and has to be edited
instead.

## LVGL simulator {#lvgl-simulator}

Apps whose GUI is built on LVGL rather than TouchGFX (the tutorials' `LVGL-GUI`
variants, starting with [HelloWorld](Tutorials/HelloWorld/ARCHITECTURE.md), and the
[RunLVGL](Tutorials/RunLVGL/ARCHITECTURE.md) activity app) simulate through the same mock
kernel, but with a plain CMake project (`LVGL-GUI/simulator/CMakeLists.txt`) instead of
the Designer-generated Visual Studio solution and gcc Makefile. `SDK::Simulator::LvglHost` (`Libs/Source/Simulator/LVGL`)
stands in for the kernel's display, ticks and buttons: an SDL2 window shows the frames
the LVGL port sends, a thread posts `EVENT_GUI_TICK` at the watch's frame rate, and the
keyboard stands in for the buttons. Keys 1-4 are the physical buttons L1, L2, R1, R2:
key down sends the press event, key up sends the release, and a key up within 500 ms
sends a click first, the sequence the kernel emits. The `q`/`w`/`e`/`r` row sends one
press and the `a`/`s`/`d`/`f` row one release for the same four buttons, the way the
TouchGFX simulators pass those codes from `SDK/GUI/Button.hpp` straight through (the
`z` chord has no key). `cmake/una-simulator.cmake`
provides the source lists and `una_simulator_link_sdl2()`, which uses an installed SDL2
where CMake can find one and otherwise, on Windows, the 32-bit SDL2 shipped with
TouchGFX Designer. The build's architecture must match the SDL2 it links: 32-bit with the
TouchGFX copy, x64 with a 64-bit installed package. The compiler is whatever CMake
finds: GCC on Linux and WSL, MSVC on Windows. MSVC comes with the free *Build Tools for
Visual Studio* as well as with the IDE, whose "C++ CMake tools for Windows" component
also brings CMake and Ninja; the Ninja generator drives it from a developer command
prompt (the x86 one for the 32-bit build), and the Visual Studio generator (`-A Win32`)
works from any shell and also writes a solution to open in the IDE. Neither
TouchGFX Designer nor Visual Studio is needed when SDL2 is installed. The sensor
simulation, mock file system and keyboard mapping above apply unchanged.
`.github/workflows/linux-simulator.yml` builds these CMake simulators on Linux and
smoke-runs them headlessly, beside the TouchGFX ones.

## Linux (GCC) {#linux-gcc}

The simulator builds and runs on x86-64 Linux using GCC and SDL2. TouchGFX Designer is Windows-only, so on Linux you build and run directly from the command line rather than through the Designer/Visual Studio GUI.

### Build and run

This assumes the SDK is cloned and `UNA_SDK` is exported, per [SDK Setup](sdk-setup.md). Unlike the firmware build, the desktop simulator does **not** need the ST ARM toolchain; it needs GCC, SDL2, and Ruby.

From an app's `TouchGFX-GUI` directory (for example `Examples/Apps/Running/Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI`):

```bash
# Simulator dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libjpeg-dev ruby ruby-nokogiri

# Build (UNA_SDK is the absolute path to the repo root)
UNA_SDK=/absolute/path/to/una-sdk make -f simulator/gcc/Makefile -j"$(nproc)"

# Run headless (no X display needed)
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy ./build/bin/simulator.out
```

The build links `touchgfx SDL2 SDL2_image jpeg rt m pthread dl`. To add your own headers or sources to the Linux build, edit `simulator/gcc/Makefile` (`ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS` / `ADDITIONAL_SOURCES_UNA`), as described under [GCC](#gcc) above.

### What makes the Linux build work

Linux support is spread across the repo rather than in one place:

- **SDK (`Libs/`)** — the simulator layer is platform-split with `#ifdef _WIN32` / `#else`: POSIX `GetTickCount64()` / `Sleep()` shims (via `clock_gettime` and `usleep`), a `dirent`-based FileSystem backend, message-size `static_assert`s guarded to 32-bit (ARM) builds with `#if __SIZEOF_POINTER__ == 4`, and a C-valid plain `strncpy` in `StdLibWrappers.c`.
- **Vendored TouchGFX tooling (`ThirdParty/`)** — the Linux asset converters carry the execute bit and the `textconvert` Ruby scripts run on modern Ruby. See [`ThirdParty-Local-Patches.md`](ThirdParty-Local-Patches.md).
- **Per-app config** — each `TouchGFX-GUI` project tracks `config/gcc/app.mk` (it holds the repo-relative `touchgfx_path` the Linux `una/Makefile` hard-includes), adds `-no-pie` to the Linux linker options in `una/Makefile`, and guards its `Windows.h` include with `#ifdef _WIN32`.
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/linux-simulator.yml` builds and headlessly smoke-runs the simulator (non-gating).
