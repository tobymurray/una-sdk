# UNA-Watch Simulator

The UNA Simulator runs on Windows (via TouchGFX Designer and Visual Studio) and on x86-64 Linux (via GCC and SDL2). The Getting Started steps below cover the Windows workflow; for Linux, see [Linux (GCC)](#linux-gcc).   
Note: If you move the application to another location, you need to update the relative path to **TouchGFX library path**.
      See: [Transfer Application](#transfer-application) 
## Getting Started
### Need Components
1. Download and install [TouchGFX Designer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/touchgfxdesigner.html#get-software).
2. If you want to work with UNA Simulator in Visual Studio, then:
   - Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).
   - In the Installing window, where you select the required packages, go to **Workloads → Desktop & Mobile** and choose **Desktop development with C++**.
   - In **Installation Details**, for **Desktop development with C++** select **MSVC v143**, then click **Install**.
### Install UNA_SDK variable {#install-una-sdk-variable}
1. Run the PowerShell script **export-stm32-tools.ps1**, located in:  
   `Utilities\Scripts\export-stm32-tools.ps1`
2. This script sets the UNA_SDK environment variable and configures STM32 tools.
### Start Simulator
#### TouchGFX Designer
1. TouchGFX Designer does not support **Debug mode**. If you want to debug the project, use Visual Studio.
2. Open `<name>.touchgfx`, located in:  
   `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI`
3. When opening the project for the first time, click **Generate Code (F4)**. This only needs to be done once.
4. Click **Run Simulator (F5)**.
#### Visual Studio
1. This step only needs to be done **once**. Open the application project in TouchGFX Designer and click **Generate Code (F4)**.
2. Go to:  
   `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator\msvs`
3. Open the **Application.vcxproj** file.
4. Start debugging by pressing **F5**.
### Simulation 
#### Buttons
1. Mechanical buttons in the UNA Simulator are controlled using **keyboard keys**.
2. You can see the mapping in the **Terminal Log**, which shows which number keys correspond to the buttons on the UNA watch.
   ```
   ---------------------------------------------------
   |   For Simulation Button use keyboard Keys.      |
   |       Keys Keyboard:                            |
   |       1   L1,                                   |

   | BUTTON DOWN L2 |             | R2 BUTTON BACK   |
   |                 \           /                   |
   |                  \---------/                    |
   ---------------------------------------------------
   ```
#### Buzzer
1. Buzzer actions are printed in the terminal as log messages. Example:
   ```cpp
   I- Mock.Buzzer::play::39               : [0] time=150 ms, level=3
   I- Mock.Buzzer::play::39               : [1] time=100 ms, level=0
   I- Mock.Buzzer::play::39               : [2] time=150 ms, level=3
   ```
2. Explanation:
   - **[]** — note array index
   - **time** — duration in milliseconds
   - **level** — sound level (1–3), 0 means no sound 
#### Backlight
1. Backlight actions are printed in the terminal as log messages.
   ```cpp
   I- Mock.Backlight::on::22              : called, timeout = 5000
   I- Mock.Backlight::off::30             : off backlight
   ```
2. There are two types of log messages:
   - turning the backlight on with a timeout in milliseconds
   - turning the backlight off
#### Vibro
1. Vibro actions are printed in the terminal as log messages.
   ```cpp
   I- Mock.Vibro::play::31                : play(melody[1])
   I- Mock.Vibro::play::34                :   [0] effect=1, loop=0, pause=0
   ```
2. Explanation:
   - **[]** — note array index
   - **effect** — vibration effect ID
   - **loop** — number of repetitions
   - **pause** — pause between effects
#### Sensors
In the file **ConfigurationSimulator.hpp**, you can enable/disable sensor simulation and configure parameters.
Location:
`<app-name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator`

For examples of sensor integration and data handling, see the [Sensors Tutorial](Tutorials/Sensors/ARCHITECTURE.md).
##### GPS
- Simulates **speed, altitude, and distance**.

- Includes a timer for **satellite acquisition**.
- Can simulate **GPS signal loss**.
- Adds **noise to latitude/longitude**.

Configuration options:
   - enable/disable sensor
   - minimum and maximum speed
   - satellite search time
  ```cpp
   //GPS Sensor
   #define GPS_SIM_ENABLE               1  // 0 - Disable

   - **RHR** (Resting Heart Rate)
   - **trust level**

Options:
   - enable/disable sensor
   - minimum and maximum heart rate
   - training type (**Cycling / Hiking / Running**)
  ```cpp
   //HeartRate Sensor
   #define HEART_RATE_SIM_ENABLE        1 // 0 - Disable
   #define HEART_RATE_SIM_MIN_HR        50
   #define HEART_RATE_SIM_MAX_HR        140
   #define HEART_RATE_SIM_TYPE_TRAINING 0 // 0 - Cycling, 1 - Hiking, 2 - Running
  ```
##### Battery Level
Simulates battery voltage drop.

Options:
   - enable/disable sensor
   - initial value
   - decrease step
  ```cpp
   // Battery Level Sensor
   #define BATT_LEVEL_SIM_ENABLE      1 // 0 - Disable
   #define BATT_LEVEL_SIM_START_VALUE 100 // 10 - 100%
   #define BATT_LEVEL_SIM_STEP_VALUE  0.1 //percent
  ```
##### Pressure
Simulates Presure value.

Options:
   - enable/disable sensor
   - set value pressure, which changes in a small range
  ```cpp
   // Pressure Sensor
   #define PRESSURE_SIM_ENABLE       1 // 0 - Disable
   #define PRESSURE_SIM_PRESS_VALLUE 1020.2
  ```
##### IMU Wrist Detection
Simulates **wrist detection**.

A wrist detection event activates the **backlight for 5 seconds**.

Options:
   - enable/disable sensor
   - change the key used to trigger the event

To simulate a wrist detection event, press **key 5**.
  ```cpp
   // IMU Writs Sensor
   #define IMU_WRIST_SIM_ENABLE           1 // 0 - Disable
   #define IMU_WRIST_SIM_WRIST_DETECT_KEY 5 
  ```
##### IMU Step Counter
Simulates **Step Counter**. Step Counter get Speed with the GPS Speed module and convert to steps.

Options:
   - enable/disable sensor

  ```cpp
   // IMU StepCounter Sensor
   #define IMU_STEP_COUNTER_SIM_ENABLE    1 // 0 - Disable
  ```

##### IMU Fusion (accel + gyro)
Simulates the **FUSION_RAW** sensor: a continuous 6-axis stream (accelerometer + gyroscope, raw int16 values) at whatever rate the app requests (e.g. period 10 ms / latency 100 ms for 100 Hz in 10-sample batches).

Two data sources:

1. **Synthetic** (default): a resting wrist (gravity on +Z) plus racquet-swing bursts injected from the keyboard. Press **key 6** to queue one swing; successive swings alternate **forehand / backhand** (mirrored gyro sign), so swing counting, swing-speed and stroke-side classification can all be exercised. Output is deterministic.
2. **CSV playback**: set `IMU_FUSION_SIM_CSV_PATH` to a recording and it replays in a loop (sample-and-hold between rows). Format — one sample per line, `#` comments and one header line allowed:

   ```
   t_ms,ax,ay,az,gx,gy,gz
   ```

   `t_ms` is a strictly increasing float timestamp in milliseconds (only deltas matter); the six values are raw signed 16-bit sensor units. A file that fails to parse is reported in the log and the sensor falls back to synthetic mode. Relative paths resolve against the simulator's working directory.

Options:
   - enable/disable sensor
   - change the key used to inject a swing
   - replay a CSV recording instead of the synthetic signal

  ```cpp
   // IMU Fusion Sensor (accel+gyro; CSV playback or synthetic racquet swings)
   #define IMU_FUSION_SIM_ENABLE    1   // 0 - Disable
   #define IMU_FUSION_SIM_SWING_KEY '6' // char type; queues one synthetic swing
   #define IMU_FUSION_SIM_CSV_PATH  ""  // empty - synthetic mode; else CSV path
  ```

### Include Header & Source file
#### MSVS
1. Open **Application.vcxproj** in a text editor:
     `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator\msvs
2. Add header paths to **ClInclude**.
3. Add source file paths to **ClCompile**.
#### GCC {#gcc}
1. Open **MakeFile** in text editor:
  `<app-name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI\simulator\gcc`
2. Add header paths to **ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS**.
3. Add source file paths to **ADDITIONAL_SOURCES_UNA**.
### Transfer Application {#transfer-application}
If you move the application to another location, you need to update the **TouchGFX library path**.
1. Open `<name>.touchgfx` in text editor:
    `<app_name>\Software\Apps\TouchGFX-GUI`
2. Find **"TouchGfxPath":** and update the relative path to
   `<una_sdk>/ThirdParty/touchgfx.`
Example:
   ```cpp
    "SelectedStartupLanguage": "GB",
    "TouchGfxPath": "touchgfx",
    "UIPath": ".",
   ```

4. If you move the **una_sdk** folder, you must update UNA_SDK environment variable.
   See: [Install UNA_SDK variable](#install-una-sdk-variable) 

## Linux (GCC) {#linux-gcc}

The simulator builds and runs on x86-64 Linux using GCC and SDL2. TouchGFX Designer is Windows-only, so on Linux you build and run directly from the command line rather than through the Designer/Visual Studio GUI.

### Build and run

This assumes the SDK is cloned and `UNA_SDK` is exported, per [SDK Setup](sdk-setup.md). Unlike the firmware build, the desktop simulator does **not** need the ST ARM toolchain; it needs GCC, SDL2, and Ruby.

From an app's `TouchGFX-GUI` directory (for example `Examples/Apps/Running/Software/Apps/TouchGFX-GUI`):

```bash
# Simulator dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libjpeg-dev ruby ruby-nokogiri

# Build (UNA_SDK is the absolute path to the repo root)
UNA_SDK=/absolute/path/to/una-sdk make -f simulator/gcc/Makefile -j"$(nproc)"

# Run headless (no X display needed)
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy ./build/bin/simulator.out
```

The build links `touchgfx SDL2 SDL2_image jpeg rt m pthread dl`. To add your own headers or sources to the Linux build, edit `simulator/gcc/Makefile` (`ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_PATHS` / `ADDITIONAL_SOURCES_UNA`), as described under [GCC](#gcc) above.

### What makes the Linux build work

Linux support is spread across the repo rather than in one place:

- **SDK (`Libs/`)** — the simulator layer is platform-split with `#ifdef _WIN32` / `#else`: POSIX `GetTickCount64()` / `Sleep()` shims (via `clock_gettime` and `usleep`), a `dirent`-based FileSystem backend, message-size `static_assert`s guarded to 32-bit (ARM) builds with `#if __SIZEOF_POINTER__ == 4`, and a C-valid plain `strncpy` in `StdLibWrappers.c`.
- **Vendored TouchGFX tooling (`ThirdParty/`)** — the Linux asset converters carry the execute bit and the `textconvert` Ruby scripts run on modern Ruby. See [`ThirdParty-Local-Patches.md`](ThirdParty-Local-Patches.md).
- **Per-app config** — each `TouchGFX-GUI` project tracks `config/gcc/app.mk` (it holds the repo-relative `touchgfx_path` the Linux `una/Makefile` hard-includes), adds `-no-pie` to the Linux linker options in `una/Makefile`, and guards its `Windows.h` include with `#ifdef _WIN32`.
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/linux-simulator.yml` builds and headlessly smoke-runs the simulator (non-gating).
